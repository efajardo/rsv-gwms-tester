# rsv-gwms-tester

Architecure
===========
rsv-gwms-tester is identical to the one of [rvs-vo-gwms](https://github.com/opensciencegrid/rsv-vo-gwms).
Except it submits Condor-C jobs instead of Condor Vanilla jobs. In this regard it acts as a [GlideinWMS Factory](https://glideinwms.fnal.gov/doc.prd/factory/index.html). This way it does not need a GlideinWMS Frontend to work as rsv-vo-gwms does.

Requirements
============

1. An X509 certificate with the VOMS extension of the Virtual Organization (VO).
1. A RedHat running machine where rsv-gwms-tester can be installed as root

Installation
